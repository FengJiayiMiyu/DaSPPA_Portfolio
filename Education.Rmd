## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Existence of universities, total numbers of universities, constitutional protection for academic freedom, freedom to research and teach, freedom of academic exchange and dissemination, institutional autonomy, campus integrity, academic as critics, international legal commitment to academic freedom under ICESCR

## Education

According to the V-Dem datasets, there are two available indicators regarding the quality of education. One is the average years of education in the total population aged older than 15, whose data was collected from 1820-2022. The other is the educational inequality level estimated from the average education data collected from 1850-2010. In the following analysis, the data from 1984 to the most recent year of the available data is used.

Here is one of the source links for the data:

<https://clio-infra.eu/Indicators/AverageYearsofEducation.html>

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
d <- read_csv("_DataPublic_/vdem/1984_2022/vdem_1984_2022_external.csv")

```

### Select data and rename data

```{r}
d_edu <- d |> 
  select(country_name, year, e_peaveduc, e_peedgini) |>
  distinct()
```

```{r}
d_edu <- d_edu |>
  rename("Average_education_years_15plus"="e_peaveduc", "Inequality_level"="e_peedgini", "Country"="country_name","Year"="year")
```

### 5 top average level and 5 top inequality level

```{r}
# Here lists 5 countries-years that have the highest education level among its population
d_edu |>
  slice_max(order_by=Average_education_years_15plus, n=5)
```

```{r}
# Here lists 5 countries-years that suffer from the most severe inequality in education.
d_edu |>
  slice_max(order_by=Inequality_level, n=5)
```

### Data availablity

```{r}
# Here checks data availability: For which countries are the indicators of education quality available
d_edu |> 
  mutate(
    edu_average_missing=as.numeric(is.na(Average_education_years_15plus)), 
    edu_inequality_missing=as.numeric(is.na(Inequality_level)),
    .after=Average_education_years_15plus)|>
  group_by(Country)|>
  summarise(N_edu_average_missing=sum(edu_average_missing),N_edu_inequality_missing=sum(edu_inequality_missing))
```

```{r}
# Here checks data availability: For which years are the indicators of education quality available
d_edu |> 
 mutate(
    edu_average_missing=as.numeric(is.na(Average_education_years_15plus)), 
    edu_inequality_missing=as.numeric(is.na(Inequality_level)),
    .after=Average_education_years_15plus)|>
  group_by(Year)|>
  summarise(N_edu_average_missing=sum(edu_average_missing),N_edu_inequality_missing=sum(edu_inequality_missing))
```

### Change year by year

```{r}
# Here summarizes the average level of education years above 15 and inequality level
d_edu |> 
  group_by(Country)|>
  summarize(mean_years=mean(Average_education_years_15plus, na.rm=TRUE),
         mean_ineuality=mean(Inequality_level, na.rm=TRUE))
```

```{r}
# Here adds two columns of the change in education quality year by year
d_edu |>
  group_by(Country)|>
  arrange(Year) |>
  mutate(year_change = Average_education_years_15plus - lag(Average_education_years_15plus, n=1),
  ineuality_change=Inequality_level - lag(Inequality_level, n=1))|>
  ungroup()|>
  arrange(Country, Year)
```

### Overall change

```{r}
#here examines the overall change of average education years from 1984-2022
d_edu |>
  group_by(Country)|>
  arrange(Year) |>
  summarise(year_change_total = last(Average_education_years_15plus)-first(Average_education_years_15plus))|>
  ungroup()|>
  arrange(year_change_total)
```

```{r}
#here examines the overall change of inequality levels from 1984-2010
d_edu |>
  filter(Year>=1984 & Year<=2010)|>
  group_by(Country)|>
  arrange(Year) |>
  summarise(ineuality_change_total=last(Inequality_level)- first(Inequality_level))|>
  ungroup()|>
  arrange(ineuality_change_total)
```

From the available data from 1984-2022, one can see that Tajikistan's average education years in the total population aged older than 15 is the only country that decreased and Botswana's increased the most. Also, available data from 1984-2010 shows that Nepal's inequality level decreased the most by 39.820 and Costa Rica's increased by 4.123. Therefore, from the perspective of overall change, Tajikistan performed the worst and Botswana improved the best in terms of education years, and Costa Rica performed the worst and Nepal improved the best in terms of education equality.

### Mean data

```{r}
d_edu |>
  group_by(Country)|>
  summarise(Average_education_mean=mean(Average_education_years_15plus))|>
  arrange(Average_education_mean)
```

```{r}
d_edu |>
  filter(Year>=1984 & Year<=2010)|>
  group_by(Country)|>
  summarise(Inequality_mean=mean(Inequality_level))|>
  arrange(Inequality_mean)
 
```

From the perspective of average educational quality, one can see that from 1985-2022, Burkina Faso's average education years in the total population aged older than 15 is the lowest and Denmark's is the most. Also, available data from 1984-2010 shows that Austria has the most equal education and Burkina Faso has the most unequal education.
